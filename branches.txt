🎯 Testing E-commerce Checkout Flow with Selenium & TestNG 🎯

Today I automated the end-to-end checkout process of a shopping website using Selenium WebDriver with TestNG framework!
Here's a quick overview of my implementation

🔹 Test Scenario
Automated the complete flow from product selection to checkout using Chrome browser.

🔹 Key Components
Used TestNG annotations with priorities (1-4) to maintain execution sequence

🔻 @Test(priority=1) - Launch Chrome browser
🔻 @Test(priority=2) - View product description & add to cart
🔻 @Test(priority=3) - Navigate to cart
🔻 @Test(priority=4) - Complete checkout process
